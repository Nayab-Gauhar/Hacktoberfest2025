## Code Guidelines

### General
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex algorithms
- Keep functions small and focused
- Remove unused code and imports

- Use standard library headers instead of `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`
- Add header guards in .h files
- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)

**Python:**
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Add docstrings to functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable names

**JavaScript:**
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Follow consistent formatting
